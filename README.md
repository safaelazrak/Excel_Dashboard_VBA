# Excel_Dashboard_VBA

Advanced Excel project responding to the following :

We want to Analyse how Sales are evolving by Sales Territory over 2013 to 2016.

1- Load the Tables you think are necessary to complete this task and link them in the Data Model 
2- Create Dashboards to answer the following questions with Charts 
  a. First Dashboard on Sales Behaviour over years, displaying : 

- The Sales by Sales Territory and by Year, with slicers by Years and Territory
- The loss in revenues by Years and by Territory

  b. Second Dashboard
- The Sales Amount by Salesperson Name (not ID), with timeline by Years/Quarters/Months and
slicer by Territory : We want only the Salesperson Names in the Slicer.
- The Sales by Sales Territory and by Year, with timeline by Years/Quarters/Months and slicer by 
Territory

Add a Chart to your Dashboard similar to previous Chart, but this time follow the revenue by 
Territory, and Quarter, Month or Year. 
Link the Time series to the same Timeline and create a slicer 
by Territory.

3- If Dashboards are correctly linked to Source files. Sources here being the files provided 
in the Exam Folder. 
4- Bonus points: create a VBA Sub concatenating all files in a folder into one 
Workbook.
